# mouse-resize-pane [on | off]
#              If on, tmux captures the mouse and allows panes to be resized by dragging on their
#              borders.

# mouse-select-pane [on | off]
#              If on, tmux captures the mouse and when a window is split into multiple panes the
#              mouse may be used to select the current pane.  The mouse click is also passed 
#              through to the application as normal.

# mouse-select-window [on | off]
#              If on, clicking the mouse on a window name in the status line will select that win‚Äê
#              dow.

# mouse-utf8 [on | off]
#              If enabled, request mouse input as UTF-8 on UTF-8 terminals.

# mode-mouse [on | off | copy-mode]
#              Mouse state in modes.  If on, the mouse may be used to enter copy mode and copy a
#              selection by dragging, to enter copy mode and scroll with the mouse wheel, or to
#              select an option in choice mode.  If set to copy-mode, the mouse behaves as set to
#              on, but cannot be used to enter copy mode.
